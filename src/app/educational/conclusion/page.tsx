        You've now covered an incredible amount of ground! From the fundamental
        building blocks of neurons and layers, through the intricate dance of
        forward and backward propagation, to critical concepts like loss,
        overfitting, and regularization. You also understand the different
        problem types, learning paradigms, and essential data handling
        techniques.

        This foundation equips you to confidently approach building and
        understanding neural networks. Remember that practice is key. Try
        implementing these concepts using libraries like{' '}
        <Emphasis>TensorFlow</Emphasis> or <Emphasis>PyTorch</Emphasis>, and
        experiment with different architectures, activation functions, and
        regularization techniques on various datasets.

        You are well on your way from "zero to hero" in the world of neural
        networks! Keep learning, keep building, and keep exploring!
